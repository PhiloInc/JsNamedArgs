# Contributing
We welcome the contributions of all developers to maintain this application. All contributors are expected to abide by the rules described in our [Code of Conduct](/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Issues
For any questions or issues found while using the application, or for feature requests, please create a new issue to discuss with the maintainers. The issues will be monitored and correspondence will be confined to the issues.

## Pull Request
Pull Requests (PRs) for fixes or new features are welcome, though it is always a good idea to discuss any changes with the maintainers via an issue ahead of time. When submitting PRs, ensure that any fork or branch is up to date with the latest `main` branch, update any instructions in the README, and increase the version number in the `build.gradle.kts` file. Once it has been reviewed, accepted and merged in, the CI will release the new version.
